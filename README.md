# uniplate-bits
Bits and Bobs to do with Uniplate and my (in progress) Rust version.

This is mainly a place to store Haskell generic programming and Rust macro
tests and proof of concepts.

Proper demos and examples for the Rust version of Uniplate can be found in its
repo (currently [[https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-oxide]]).
